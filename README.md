**This is a demo app designed with the fascinating and modern Google's Material Design 2.
It was created using Androidx Libraries and Material Components.
It covers many material design components to show how to implement material design 2 in apps.**  
  
This app is based on my another App: [Material Design Demo](https://github.com/Eajy/MaterialDesignDemo) which is designed with MD using support libraries.
